    In this short survey and presentation, you will study a language and
    give brief presentation about its linguistic and other related
    facts, such as demographics, location, orthography, morphology,
    syntax, phonology, corpus, tools, and translation systems and
    performance. Please feel free to research on your own or consulting
    native speakers and/or language experts. <br>
