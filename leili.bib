  abstract  = {Can a robot autonomously learn to design and construct a bridge from varying-sized blocks without a blueprint? It is a challenging task with long horizon and sparse reward – the robot has to figure out physically stable design schemes and feasible actions to manipulate and transport blocks. Due to diverse block sizes, the state space and action trajectories are vast to explore. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical approach for this problem. It consists of a reinforcement-learning designer to propose high-level building instructions and a motion-planning-based action generator to manipulate blocks at the low level. For high-level learning, we develop a novel technique, prioritized memory resetting (PMR) to improve exploration. PMR adaptively resets the state to those most critical configurations from a replay buffer so that the robot can resume training on partial architectures instead of from scratch. Furthermore, we augment PMR with auxiliary training objectives and fine-tune the designer with the locomotion generator. Our experiments in simulation and on a real deployed robotic system demonstrate that it is able to effectively construct bridges with blocks of varying sizes at a high success rate.

We decompose the verification of the whole claim at phrase-level, where the veracity of the phrases serves as explanations and can be aggregated into the final verdict according to logical rules. The key insight of LOREN is to represent claim phrase veracity as three-valued latent variables, which are regularized by aggregation logical rules. The final claim verification is based on all latent variables. Thus, LOREN enjoys the additional benefit of interpretability -- it is easy to explain how it reaches certain results with claim phrase veracity. Experiments on a public fact verification benchmark show that LOREN is competitive against previous approaches while enjoying the merit of faithful and accurate interpretability.},

In this paper, we propose EDUCAT, an editing-based unsupervised approach for counterfactual story rewriting. EDUCAT includes a target position detection strategy based on estimating causal effects of the what-if conditions, which keeps the causal invariant parts of the story. EDUCAT then generates the stories under fluency, coherence and minimal-edits constraints. We also propose a new metric to alleviate the shortcomings of current automatic metrics and better evaluate the trade-off. We evaluate EDUCAT on a public counterfactual story rewriting benchmark.

First, our new framework is empowered by an efficient and holistic instance mask representation scheme, which dynamically segments each instance in the image, without resorting to bounding box detection. Specifically, the object mask generation is decoupled into a mask kernel prediction and mask feature learning, which are responsible for generating convolution kernels and the feature maps to be convolved with, respectively. Second, SOLOv2 significantly reduces inference overhead with our novel matrix non-maximum suppression (NMS) technique. Our Matrix NMS performs NMS with parallel matrix operations in one shot, and yields better results. We demonstrate that the proposed SOLOv2 achieves the state-of-the- art performance with high efficiency, making it suitable for both mobile and cloud applications. A light-weight version of SOLOv2 executes at 31.3 FPS and yields 37.1% AP on COCO test-dev. Moreover, our state-of-the-art results in object detection (from our mask byproduct) and panoptic segmentation show the potential of SOLOv2 to serve as a new strong baseline for many instance-level recognition tasks.},

To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose LogiRE, a novel probabilistic model for document-level relation extraction by learning logic rules. LogiRE treats logic rules as latent variables and consists of two modules: a rule generator and a relation extractor. The rule generator is to generate logic rules potentially contributing to final predictions, and the relation extractor outputs final predictions based on the generated logic rules. Those two modules can be efficiently optimized with the expectation--maximization (EM) algorithm. By introducing logic rules into neural networks, LogiRE can explicitly capture long-range dependencies as well as enjoy better interpretation. Empirical results show that LogiRE significantly outperforms several strong baselines in terms of relation performance (∼1.8 F1 score) and logical consistency (over 3.3 logic score).

  abstract  = {Autonomous assembly has been a desired functionality of many intelligent robot systems. We study a new challenging assembly task, designing and constructing a bridge without a blueprint. In this task, the robot needs to first design a feasible bridge architecture for arbitrarily wide cliffs and then manipulate the blocks reliably to construct a stable bridge according to the proposed design. In this paper, we propose a bi-level approach to tackle this task. At the high level, the system learns a bridge blueprint policy in a physical simulator using deep reinforcement learning and curriculum learning. A policy is represented as an attention-based neural network with object-centric input, which enables generalization to different numbers of blocks and cliff widths. For low-level control, we implement a motion-planning-based policy for real-robot motion control, which can be directly combined with a trained blueprint policy for real-world bridge construction without tuning. In our field study, our bi-level robot system demonstrates the capability of manipulating blocks to construct a diverse set of bridges with different architectures.},

  month     = sep,
  abstract  = {Grasping in cluttered scenes has always been a great challenge for robots, due to the requirement of the ability to well understand the scene and object information. Previous works usually assume that the geometry information of the objects is available, or utilize a step-wise, multi-stage strategy to predict the feasible 6-DoF grasp poses. In this work, we propose to formalize the 6-DoF grasp pose estimation as a simultaneous multi-task learning problem. In a unified framework, we jointly predict the feasible 6-DoF grasp poses, instance semantic segmentation, and collision information. The whole framework is jointly optimized and end-to-end differentiable. Our model is evaluated on large-scale benchmarks as well as the real robot system. On the public dataset, our method outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+4.08 AP). We also demonstrate the implementation of our model on a real robotic platform and show that the robot can accurately grasp target objects in cluttered scenarios with a high success rate.},

  abstract  = {Deep neural networks often have a huge number of parameters, which posts challenges in deployment in application scenarios with limited memory and computation capacity. Knowledge distillation is one approach to derive compact models from bigger ones. However, it has been observed that a converged heavy teacher model is strongly constrained for learning a compact student network and could make the optimization subject to poor local optima. In this paper, we propose ProKT, a new model-agnostic method by projecting the supervision signals of a teacher model into the student's parameter space. Such projection is implemented by decomposing the training objective into local intermediate targets with an approximate mirror descent technique. The proposed method could be less sensitive with the quirks during optimization which could result in a better local optimum. Experiments on both image and text datasets show that our proposed ProKT consistently achieves superior performance compared to other existing knowledge distillation methods.},

  abstract  = {End-to-end speech translation models have become a new trend in research due to their potential of reducing error propagation. However, these models still suffer from the challenge of data scarcity. How to effectively use unlabeled or other parallel corpora from machine translation is promising but still an open problem. In this paper, we propose Cross Speech-Text Network (XSTNet), an end-to-end model for speech-to-text translation. XSTNet takes both speech and text as input and outputs both transcription and translation text. The model benefits from its three key design aspects: a self-supervised pre-trained sub-network as the audio encoder, a multi-task training objective to exploit additional parallel bilingual text, and a progressive training procedure. We evaluate the performance of XSTNet and baselines on the MuST-C En-X and LibriSpeech En-Fr datasets. In particular, XSTNet achieves state-of-the-art results on all language directions with an average BLEU of 28.8, outperforming the previous best method by 3.2 BLEU.

Our intuition is based on the hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to better multilingual translation performance. To this end, we propose mRASP2, a training method to obtain a single unified multilingual translation model. mRASP2 is empowered by two techniques: a) a contrastive learning scheme to close the gap among representations of different languages, and b) data augmentation on both multiple parallel and monolingual data to further align token representations. For English-centric directions, mRASP2 outperforms existing best unified model and achieves competitive or even better performance than the pre-trained and fine-tuned model mBART on tens of WMT's translation directions. For non-English directions, mRASP2 achieves an improvement of average 10+ BLEU compared with the multilingual Transformer baseline.},

With GLM, we develop Glancing Transformer (GLAT) for machine translation. With only single-pass parallel decoding, GLAT is able to generate high-quality translation with 8-15 times speedup. Experiments on multiple WMT language directions show that GLAT outperforms all previous single pass non-autoregressive methods, and is nearly comparable to Transformer, reducing the gap to 0.25-0.9 BLEU points.},

This paper aims to figure out what is a good vocabulary and whether one can find the optimal vocabulary without trial training. To answer these questions, we first provide an alternative understanding of the role of vocabulary from the perspective of information theory. Motivated by this, we formulate the quest of vocabularization -- finding the best token dictionary with a proper size -- as an optimal transport (OT) problem. We propose VOLT, a simple and efficient solution without trial training. Empirical results show that VOLT outperforms widely-used vocabularies in diverse scenarios, including WMT-14 English-German and TED's 52 translation directions. For example, VOLT achieves almost 70% vocabulary size reduction and 0.5 BLEU gain on English-German translation. Also, compared to BPE-search, VOLT reduces the search time from 384 GPU hours to 30 GPU hours on English-German translation.},

Existing work focuses on developing deep generative models to generate either sequences or chemical molecular graphs. However, it remains a great challenge to find novel and diverse compounds satisfying many properties. In this paper, we propose MARS, a method for multi-objective drug molecule discovery. MARS is based on the idea of generating the chemical candidates by iterative editing fragments of molecular graphs. To search for the best candidates, it employs an annealing scheme together with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC) on molecules. To further improve sample efficiency, MARS is equipped with a graph neural network (GNN) as the proposal for candidate edits on molecules, while the GNN is trained on-the-fly utilizing the sample paths in MCMC. Our experiments show that MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance in various multi-objective settings where molecular bio-activity, drug-likeness, and synthesizability are simultaneously considered.  In the most challenging setting where four objectives – bio-activities to two different targets, drug-likeness and synthesizability – are simultaneously considered, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly in a comprehensive evaluation.},

  abstract  = {Sponsored search auction is a crucial component of modern search engines. It requires a set of candidate bidwords that advertisers can place bids on. Existing methods generate bidwords from search queries or advertisement content. However, they suffer from the data noise in <query, bidword> and <advertisement, bidword> pairs. In this paper, we propose a triangular bidword generation model (TRIDENT), which takes the high-quality data of paired <query, advertisement> as a supervision signal to indirectly guide the bidword generation process. Our proposed model is simple yet effective: by using bidword as the bridge between search query and advertisement, the generation of search query, advertisement and bidword can be jointly learned in the triangular training framework. This alleviates the problem that the training data of bidword may be noisy. Experimental results, including automatic and human evaluations, show that our proposed TRIDENT can generate relevant and diverse bidwords for both search queries and advertisements. Our evaluation on online real data validates the effectiveness of the TRIDENT’s generated bidwords for product search.},

To this end, we propose a novel and effective approach, termed SOLOv2, following the principle of the SOLO method. First, our new framework is empowered by an efficient and holistic instance mask representation scheme, which dynamically segments each instance in the image, without resorting to bounding box detection. Specifically, the object mask generation is decoupled into a mask kernel prediction and mask feature learning, which are responsible for generating convolution kernels and the feature maps to be convolved with, respectively. Second, SOLOv2 significantly reduces inference overhead with our novel matrix non-maximum suppression (NMS) technique. Our Matrix NMS performs NMS with parallel matrix operations in one shot, and yields better results. We demonstrate that the proposed SOLOv2 achieves the state-of-the- art performance with high efficiency, making it suitable for both mobile and cloud applications. A light-weight version of SOLOv2 executes at 31.3 FPS and yields 37.1% AP on COCO test-dev. Moreover, our state-of-the-art results in object detection (from our mask byproduct) and panoptic segmentation show the potential of SOLOv2 to serve as a new strong baseline for many instance-level recognition tasks.},

However, the sentence embeddings from the pre-trained language models without fine-tuning have been found to poorly capture semantic meaning of sentences. In this paper, we argue that the semantic information in the BERT embeddings is not fully exploited. We first reveal the theoretical connection between the masked language model pre-training objective and the semantic similarity task theoretically, and then analyze the BERT sentence embeddings empirically. We find that BERT always induces a non-smooth anisotropic semantic space of sentences, which harms its performance of semantic similarity. To address this issue, we propose to transform the anisotropic sentence embedding distribution to a smooth and isotropic Gaussian distribution through normalizing flows that are learned with an unsupervised objective. Experimental results show that our proposed BERT-flow method obtains significant performance gains over the state-of-the-art sentence embeddings on a variety of semantic textual similarity tasks.},

We carry out extensive experiments on 42 translation directions across a diverse settings, including low, medium, rich resource, and as well as transferring to exotic language pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that mRASP achieves significant performance improvement compared to directly training on those target pairs. It is the first time to verify that multiple low-esource language pairs can be utilized to improve rich resource MT.

The crux is that the number of training samples for Maximum Likelihood Estimation is usually limited and the input data distributions are different at training and inference stages.  Many method shave been proposed to solve the above problem (Yu et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2018), which relies  on  sampling  from  the  non-stationary model distribution and suffers from high variance  or  biased  estimations.   In  this  paper, we  proposeψ-MLE,  a  new  training  scheme for auto-regressive sequence generative models, which is effective and stable when operating at large sample space encountered in text generation.   We  derive  our  algorithm  from a  new  perspective  of  self-augmentation  and introduce  bias  correction  with  density  ratio estimation.   Extensive  experimental  results on  synthetic  data  and  real-world  text  generation  tasks  demonstrate  that  our  method stably outperforms Maximum Likelihood Estimation and other state-of-the-art sequence generative  models  in  terms  of  both  quality and diversity.},

Compared to many other dense prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, it is the arbitrary number of instances that have made instance segmentation much more challenging. In order to predict a mask for each instance, mainstream approaches either follow the 'detect-thensegment' strategy as used by Mask R-CNN, or predict category masks first then use clustering techniques to group pixels into individual instances. We view the task of instance segmentation from a completely new perspective by introducing the notion of "instance categories", which assigns categories to each pixel within an instance according to the instance's location and size, thus nicely converting instance mask segmentation into a classification-solvable problem. Now instance segmentation is decomposed into two classification tasks. We demonstrate a much simpler and flexible instance segmentation framework with strong performance, achieving on par accuracy with Mask R-CNN and outperforming recent singleshot instance segmenters in accuracy. We hope that this very simple and strong framework can serve as a baseline for many instance-level recognition tasks besides instance segmentation.},

  year      = {2020},
  month     = jul,
  abstract  = {Deep generative models are commonly used for generating images and text. Interpretability of these models is one important pursuit, other than the generation quality. Variational auto-encoder (VAE) with Gaussian distribution as prior has been successfully applied in text generation, but it is hard to interpret the meaning of the latent variable. To enhance the controllability and interpretability, one can replace the Gaussian prior with a mixture of Gaussian distributions (GM-VAE), whose mixture components could be related to hidden semantic aspects of data. In this paper, we generalize the practice and introduce DEM-VAE, a class of models for text generation using VAEs with a mixture distribution of exponential family. Unfortunately, a standard variational training algorithm fails due to the mode-collapse problem. We theoretically identify the root cause of the problem and propose an effective algorithm to train DEM-VAE. Our method penalizes the training with an extra dispersion term to induce a well-structured latent space.

Nonetheless, this remains a challenging task due to limited context and diverse name variations. In this paper, we study the problem of entity linking for Chinese news comments given mentions’ spans. We hypothesize that comments often refer to entities in the corresponding news article, as well as topics involving the entities. We therefore propose a novel model, XREF, that leverages attention mechanisms to (1) pinpoint relevant context within comments, and (2) detect supporting entities from the news article. To improve training, we make two contributions: (a) we propose a supervised attention loss in addition to the standard cross entropy, and (b) we develop a weakly supervised training scheme to utilize the large-scale unlabeled corpus. Two new datasets in entertainment and product domains are collected and annotated for experiments. Our proposed method outperforms previous methods on both datasets.},

While almost all state-of-the-art object detectors utilize predefined anchors to enumerate possible locations, scales and aspect ratios for the search of the objects, their performance and generalization ability are also limited to the design of anchors. Instead, FoveaBox directly learns the object existing possibility and the bounding box coordinates without anchor reference. This is achieved by: (a) predicting category-sensitive semantic maps for the object existing possibility, and (b) producing category-agnostic bounding box for each position that potentially contains an object. The scales of target boxes are naturally associated with feature pyramid representations. In FoveaBox, an instance is assigned to adjacent feature levels to make the model more accurate.We demonstrate its effectiveness on standard benchmarks and report extensive experimental analysis. Without bells and whistles, FoveaBox achieves state-of-the-art single model performance on the standard COCO and Pascal VOC object detection benchmark. More importantly, FoveaBox avoids all computation and hyper-parameters related to anchor boxes, which are often sensitive to the final detection performance. We believe the simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research for object detection.

This paper explores the problem of automatically learning reusable "templates" from paired and non-paired data. We propose the variational template machine (VTM), a novel method to generate text descriptions from data tables. Our contributions include:  a) we carefully devise a specific model architecture and losses to explicitly disentangle text template and semantic content information, in the latent spaces, and b) we utilize both small parallel data and large raw text without aligned tables to enrich the template learning. Experiments on datasets from a variety of different domains show that VTM is able generate more diversely while keeping a good fluency and quality.},

Both translation models and language models share the same latent semantic space, therefore both translation directions can learn from non-parallel data more effectively. Besides, the translation models and language models can collaborate together during decoding.

Almost all methods treat foreground and background regions (``things and stuff'') in an image equally. However, not all pixels are equal. Depth of foreground objects plays a crucial role in 3D object recognition and localization. To date how to boost the depth prediction accuracy of foreground objects is rarely discussed. In this paper, we first analyse the data distributions and interaction of foreground and background, then propose the foreground-background separated monocular depth estimation (ForeSeE) method, to estimate the foreground depth and background depth using separate optimization objectives and depth decoders.

To train such a neural headline editing model, we collected a dataset which contains articles with original headlines and professionally edited headlines. However, it is expensive to collect a large number of professionally edited headlines. To solve this low-resource problem, we design an encoder-decoder model which leverages large scale pre-trained language models. We further improve the pre-trained model's quality by introducing a headline generation task as an intermediate task before the headline editing task. Also, we propose Self Importance-Aware (SIA) loss to address the different levels of editing in the dataset by down-weighting the importance of easily classified tokens and sentences. With the help of Pre-training, Adaptation, and SIA, the model learns to generate headlines in the professional editor's style. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the quality of headline editing comparing against previous methods.},

Our proposed CTNMT consists of three techniques: a) asymptotic distillation to ensure that the NMT model can retain the previous pre-trained knowledge; b) a dynamic switching gate to avoid catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge; and c) a strategy to adjust the learning paces according to a scheduled policy. Our experiments in machine translation show CTNMT gains of up

While for the large WMT14 English-French task with 40 millions of sentencepairs, our base model still significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art Transformer big model by more than 1 BLEU score.},

  abstract  = {Modern online-auction-based advertising systems utilize user and item features to automatically place ads. In order to train a model to rank the most profitable ads, new ad creatives have to be placed online for hours to receive sufficient user-click data. This corresponds to the cold-start stage. Random strategy lead to inefficiency and inferior selections of potential ads. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of content-based selection during the cold-start stage. Specifically, we propose Pre Evaluation of Ad Creative Model (PEAC), a novel method to evaluate and select ad creatives offline before being placed online. Our proposed PEAC utilizes the automatically extracted deep feature from ad content to predict and rank their potential online placement performance.

  abstract  = {In this study, we first investigate a novel capsule network with dynamic routing for linear time Neural Machine Translation (NMT), referred as CAPSNMT. CAPSNMT uses an aggregation mechanism to map the source sentence into a matrix with pre-determined size, and then applys a deep LSTM network to decode the target sequence from the source representation. Unlike the previous work (Sutskever et al., 2014) to store the source sentence with a passive and bottom-up way, the dynamic routing policy encodes the source sentence with an iterative process to decide the credit attribution between nodes from lower and higher layers. CAPSNMT has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and provides a more flexible way to aggregate the part-whole information of the source sentence. On WMT14 English-German task and a larger WMT14 English-French task, CAPSNMT achieves comparable results with the Transformer system. We also devise new hybrid architectures intended to combine the strength of CAPSNMT and the RNMT model. Our hybrid models obtain state-of-the-arts results on both benchmark datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that capsule networks have been empirically investigated for sequence to sequence problems},

However, all existing NDVR datasets are introduced for long videos. Furthermore, most of them are small-scale and lack of diversity due to the high cost of collecting and labeling near-duplicate videos. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale short video dataset, called SVD, for the NDVR task. SVD contains over 500,000 short videos and over 30,000 labeled videos of near-duplicates. We use multiple video mining techniques to construct positive/negative pairs. Furthermore, we design temporal and spatial transformations to mimic user-attack behavior in real applications for constructing more difficult variants of SVD. Experiments show that existing state-of-the-art NDVR methods, including real-value based and hashing based methods, fail to achieve satisfactory performance on this challenging dataset. The release of SVD dataset will foster research and system engineering in the NDVR area. The SVD dataset is available at https://svdbase.github.io.},

Extensive experiments on the VATEX dataset show that, first, the unified multilingual model can not only produce both English and Chinese descriptions for a video more efficiently, but also offer improved performance over the monolingual models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatiotemporal video context can be effectively utilized to align source and target languages and thus assist machine translation.

  abstract  = {Text attribute transfer is modifying certain linguistic attributes (e.g. sentiment, style, authorship, etc.) of a sentence and transforming them from one type to another. In this paper, we aim to analyze and interpret what is changed during the transfer process. We start from the observation that in many existing models and datasets, certain words within a sentence play important roles in determining the sentence attribute class. These words are referred to as the Pivot Words. Based on these pivot words, we propose a lexical analysis framework, the Pivot Analysis, to quantitatively analyze the effects of these words in text attribute classification and transfer. We apply this framework to existing datasets and models, and show that: (1) the pivot words are strong features for the classification of sentence attributes; (2) to change the attribute of a sentence, many datasets only requires to change certain pivot words; (3) consequently, many transfer models only perform the lexical-level modification, while leaving higher-level sentence structures unchanged. Our work provides an in-depth understanding of linguistic attribute transfer and further identifies the future requirements and challenges of this task.},

However, due to the lack of fine-grained datarecording such merging phenomena, the co-driven mechanism ofsocial and content links in churn phenomena remains unexplored.How do social and content factors jointly influence customers’churn? What is the best ratio of social and content links for a user’sretention? Is there a model to capture this co-driven mechanism inusers’ churn phenomena?In this paper, we collect a real-world dataset with more than 5.77million users and 925 million links, with each link being tagged asa social one or a content one. We find that both social and contentlinks have a significant impact on users’ churn and theywork jointlyas a complicated mixture effect. As a result, we propose a novelsurvival model, which incorporates both social and content factors,to predict churn probability over time. Our model successfully fitsthe churn distribution in reality and accurately predicts the churnrate of different subpopulations in the future. By analyzing themodeling parameters, we try to strike a balance between socialdrivenand content-driven links in a user’s social network to reachthe lowest churn rate.

To solve bothissues, we propose CAMIT, a novel method for translating in an interactive environment. Our proposed method works with critical revision instructions,therefore allows human to correct arbitrary words in model-translated sentences. In addition,CAMIT learns from and softly memorizes revision actions based on the context, alleviating the issue of repeating mistakes.

We evaluate DFGN on HotpotQA, a public TBQA dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning. DFGN achieves competitive results on the public board.

In this paper, we propose BRITS, a novel method based on recurrent neural networks for missing value imputation in time series data. Our proposed method directly learns the missing values in a bidirectional recurrent dynamical system, without any specific assumption.

Though trivial trees contain no syntactic information, those encoders get competitive or even better results on all of the ten downstream tasks we investigated. This surprising result indicates that explicit syntax guidance may not be the main contributor to the superior performances of tree-based neural sentence modeling.

Our model has the following advantages: (a) unification power: it explains earlier empirical observations and generalizes theoretical models including the SI and SIR models. We provide the threshold of the take-off vs. die-out conditions for SPIKEM, and discuss the generality of our model, by applying it to an arbitrary graph topology; (b) practicality: it matches the observed behavior of diverse sets of real data; (c) parsimony: it requires only a handful of parameters; and (d) usefulness: it makes it possible to perform analytic tasks such as forecasting, spotting anomalies, and interpretation by reverse engineering the system parameters of interest (e.g. quality of news, number of interested bloggers, etc.). We also introduce an efficient and effective algorithm for the real-time monitoring of information diffusion, namely, SPIKESTREAM, which identifies multiple diffusion patterns in a large collection of online event streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that SPIKEM accurately and succinctly describes all the patterns of the rise-and-fall spikes in social networks.},

  abstract  = {How can we enable computers to automatically answer questions like ``Who created the character Harry Potter''? Carefully built knowledge bases provide rich sources of facts. However, it remains a challenge to answer factoid questions raised in natural language due to numerous expressions of one question. In particular, we focus on the most common questions --- ones that can be answered with a single fact in the knowledge base. We propose CFO, a Conditional Focused neural-network-based approach to answering factoid questions with knowledge bases. Our approach first zooms in a question to find more probable candidate subject mentions, and infers the final answers with a unified conditional probabilistic framework. Powered by deep recurrent neural networks and neural embeddings, our proposed CFO achieves an accuracy of 75.7\% on a dataset of 108k questions - the largest public one to date. It outperforms the current state of the art by an absolute margin of 11.8\%.},

In this paper, we explic- itly analyze the equivalence between these two semantics in the context of open- universe probability models (OUPMs). We propose a novel dynamic memoization technique to construct OUPMs using procedural instructions in random-evaluation based PPLs. We implemented a translator named BFiT, which converts code in BLOG (possible-world based) to Figaro (random-evaluation based). The trans- lated program in Figaro exhibits a merely constant blowup factor in program size while yielding the same inference results as the original model in BLOG.},

We examine the case in which the relationship Z = f(X1,...,Xk) holds, where each Xi has a continuous prior pdf and we wish to obtain samples from the conditional distribution P(X1,...,Xk | Z = s). When f is addition, the problem is NP-hard even when the Xi are independent. In more restricted cases—for example, i.i.d. Boolean or categorical Xi—efficient exact samplers have been obtained previously. For the general continuous case, we propose a dynamic scaling algorithm (DYSC), and prove that it has O(k) expected running time and finite variance. We discuss generalizations of DYSC to functions f described by binary operation trees. We evaluate the algorithm on several examples.},

We demonstrate this human input approach through an example application of handwriting recognition. By treating the input as a time series of 3D positions, we propose a fast algorithm using dynamic time warping to recognize characters in online fashion. We employ various optimization techniques to recognize in real time as one writes. Experiments show promising recognition performance and speed.},

Particle filters fail for models that include such variables, while methods that use Gibbs sampling of parameter variables may incur a per-sample cost that grows linearly with the length of the observation sequence. Storvik devised a method for incremental computation of exact sufficient statistics that, for some cases, reduces the per-sample cost to a constant. In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between Storvik's filter and a Kalman filter in parameter space and establish more general conditions under which Storvik's filter works. Drawing on an analogy to the extended Kalman filter, we develop and analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, a Taylor approximation to the parameter posterior that allows Storvik's method to be applied to a broader class of models. Our experiments on both synthetic examples and real applications show improvement over existing methods.},

In this paper, we propose WisCom, a system that can analyze tens of millions user ratings and comments in mobile app markets at three different levels of detail. Our system is able to (a) discover inconsistencies in reviews; (b) identify reasons why users like or dislike a given app, and provide an interactive, zoomable view of how users’ reviews evolve over time; and (c) provide valuable insights into the entire app market, identifying users’ major concerns and preferences of different types of apps. Results using our techniques are reported on a 32GB dataset consisting of over 13 million user reviews of 171,493 Android apps in the Google Play Store. We discuss how the techniques presented herein can be deployed to help a mobile app market operator such as Google as well as individual app developers and end-users.},

  abstract  = {Efficient thermal management is important in modern data centers as cooling consumes up to 50% of the total energy. Unlike previous work, we consider proactive thermal management, whereby servers can predict potential overheating events due to dynamics in data center configuration and workload, giving operators enough time to react. However, such forecasting is very challenging due to data center scales and complexity. Moreover, such a physical system is influenced by cyber effects, including workload scheduling in servers. We propose ThermoCast, a novel thermal forecasting model to predict the temperatures surrounding the servers in a data center, based on continuous streams of temperature and airflow measurements. Our approach is (a) capable of capturing cyber- physical interactions and automatically learning them from data; (b) computationally and physically scalable to data center scales; (c) able to provide online prediction with real-time sensor mea- surements. The paper’s main contributions are: (i) We provide a systematic approach to integrate physical laws and sensor observa- tions in a data center; (ii) We provide an algorithm that uses sensor data to learn the parameters of a data center’s cyber-physical sys- tem. In turn, this ability enables us to reduce model complexity compared to full-fledged fluid dynamics models, while maintain- ing forecast accuracy; (iii) Unlike previous simulation-based stud- ies, we perform experiments in a production data center. Using real data traces, we show that ThermoCast forecasts temperature 2× better than a machine learning approach solely driven by data, and can successfully predict thermal alarms 4.2 minutes ahead of time.},

Our goal is to make use of the multi-core as well as multi-processor architectures to speed up large-scale data mining algorithms. In this paper, we present a general par- allel learning framework, Cut-And-Stitch, for training hidden Markov chain models. Particularly, we propose two model-specific variants, CAS-LDS for learning linear dynamical systems (LDS) and CAS-HMM for learning hidden Markov models (HMM). Our main contribution is a novel method to handle the data dependencies due to the chain structure of hidden variables, so as to parallelize the EM-based parameter learning algorithm. We imple- ment CAS-LDS and CAS-HMM using OpenMP on two supercomputers and a quad-core commercial desktop. The experimental results show that parallel algorithms using Cut-And-Stitch achieve comparable accuracy and almost linear speedups over the traditional serial version.},

  abstract  = {Multi-core processors with ever increasing number of cores per chip are becoming prevalent in modern parallel computing. Our goal is to make use of the multi-core as well as multi-processor architectures to speed up data mining algorithms. Specifically, we present a parallel algorithm for approximate learning of Linear Dynamical Systems (LDS), also known as Kalman Filters (KF). LDSs are widely used in time series analysis such as motion capture modeling and visual tracking etc. We propose Cut-And-Stitch (CAS), a novel method to handle the data dependencies due to the chain structure of hidden variables in LDS, so as to parallelize the EM- based parameter learning algorithm. We implement the algorithm using OpenMP on both a supercomputer and a quad-core commercial desktop. The experimental results show that parallel algorithms using Cut-And-Stitch achieve comparable accuracy and almost linear speedups over the serial version. In addition, Cut-And-Stitch can be generalized to other models with similar linear structures such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Switching Kalman Filters (SKF).},
