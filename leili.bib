  abstract  = {How can we enable computers to automatically answer questions like ``Who created the character Harry Potter''? Carefully built knowledge bases provide rich sources of facts. However, it remains a challenge to answer factoid questions raised in natural language due to numerous expressions of one question. In particular, we focus on the most common questions --- ones that can be answered with a single fact in the knowledge base. We propose CFO, a Conditional Focused neural-network-based approach to answering factoid questions with knowledge bases. Our approach first zooms in a question to find more probable candidate subject mentions, and infers the final answers with a unified conditional probabilistic framework. Powered by deep recurrent neural networks and neural embeddings, our proposed CFO achieves an accuracy of 75.7\% on a dataset of 108k questions - the largest public one to date. It outperforms the current state of the art by an absolute margin of 11.8\%.},

  abstract  = {A probabilistic program defines a probability measure over its semantic structures. One common goal of probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) is to compute posterior probabilities for arbitrary models and queries, given observed evidence, using a generic inference engine. Most PPL inference engines—even the compiled ones—incur significant runtime interpretation overhead, especially for contingent and open-universe models. This paper describes Swift, a compiler for the BLOG PPL. Swift-generated code incorporates optimizations that eliminate interpretation overhead, maintain dynamic dependencies efficiently, and handle memory management for possible worlds of varying sizes. Experiments comparing Swift with other PPL engines on a variety of inference problems demonstrate speedups ranging from 12x to 326x.},

However, factorizing a user-product score matrix is computation and memory intensive. We propose Maxios, a novel approach to fill missing values for large scale and highly sparse matrices efficiently and ac- curately. We formulate the matrix-completion problem as weighted nonnegative matrix factorization. In addition, we develop distributed update rules using alter- nating direction method of multipliers. We have implemented the Maxios system on top of Spark, a distributed in-memory computation framework. Experiments on commercial clusters show that Maxios is competitive in terms of scalability and accuracy against the existing solutions on a variety of datasets.},

In this paper, we explic- itly analyze the equivalence between these two semantics in the context of open- universe probability models (OUPMs). We propose a novel dynamic memoization technique to construct OUPMs using procedural instructions in random-evaluation based PPLs. We implemented a translator named BFiT, which converts code in BLOG (possible-world based) to Figaro (random-evaluation based). The trans- lated program in Figaro exhibits a merely constant blowup factor in program size while yielding the same inference results as the original model in BLOG.},

  Abstract                 = {The parameters of temporal models, such as dynamic Bayesian networks, may be modelled in a Bayesian context as static or atemporal variables that influence transition probabilities at every time step. Particle filters fail for models that include such variables, while methods that use Gibbs sampling of parameter variables may incur a per-sample cost that grows linearly with the length of the observation sequence. Storvik devised a method for incremental computation of exact sufficient statistics that, for some cases, reduces the per-sample cost to a constant. In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between Storvik's filter and a Kalman filter in parameter space and establish more general conditions under which Storvik's filter works. Drawing on an analogy to the extended Kalman filter, we develop and analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, a Taylor approximation to the parameter posterior that allows Storvik's method to be applied to a broader class of models. Our experiments on both synthetic examples and real applications show improvement over existing methods.},

In these new platforms, users establishlinks to others not only driven by their social relationships in thephysical world but also driven by the contents published by others.During this merging process, social networks gradually integrateboth social and content links and become unprecedentedly complicated,with the motivation to exploit both the advantages of socialviscosity and content attractiveness to reach the best customerretention situation. However, due to the lack of fine-grained datarecording such merging phenomena, the co-driven mechanism ofsocial and content links in churn phenomena remains unexplored.How do social and content factors jointly influence customers’churn? What is the best ratio of social and content links for a user’sretention? Is there a model to capture this co-driven mechanism inusers’ churn phenomena?In this paper, we collect a real-world dataset with more than 5.77million users and 925 million links, with each link being tagged asa social one or a content one. We find that both social and contentlinks have a significant impact on users’ churn and theywork jointlyas a complicated mixture effect. As a result, we propose a novelsurvival model, which incorporates both social and content factors,to predict churn probability over time. Our model successfully fitsthe churn distribution in reality and accurately predicts the churnrate of different subpopulations in the future. By analyzing themodeling parameters, we try to strike a balance between socialdrivenand content-driven links in a user’s social network to reachthe lowest churn rate. Our model and findings may have potentialimplications for the design of future social media.},

When f is addition, the problem is NP-hard even when the Xi are independent. In more restricted cases—for example, i.i.d. Boolean or categorical Xi—efficient exact samplers have been obtained previously. For the general continuous case, we propose a dynamic scaling algorithm (DYSC), and prove that it has O(k) expected running time and finite variance. We discuss generalizations of DYSC to functions f described by binary operation trees. We evaluate the algorithm on several examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Efficient thermal management is important in modern data centers as cooling consumes up to 50% of the total energy. Unlike previous work, we consider proactive thermal management, whereby servers can predict potential overheating events due to dynamics in data center configuration and workload, giving operators enough time to react. However, such forecasting is very challenging due to data center scales and complexity. Moreover, such a physical system is influenced by cyber effects, including workload scheduling in servers. We propose ThermoCast, a novel thermal forecasting model to predict the temperatures surrounding the servers in a data center, based on continuous streams of temperature and airflow measurements. Our approach is (a) capable of capturing cyber- physical interactions and automatically learning them from data; (b) computationally and physically scalable to data center scales; (c) able to provide online prediction with real-time sensor mea- surements. The paper’s main contributions are: (i) We provide a systematic approach to integrate physical laws and sensor observa- tions in a data center; (ii) We provide an algorithm that uses sensor data to learn the parameters of a data center’s cyber-physical sys- tem. In turn, this ability enables us to reduce model complexity compared to full-fledged fluid dynamics models, while maintain- ing forecast accuracy; (iii) Unlike previous simulation-based stud- ies, we perform experiments in a production data center. Using real data traces, we show that ThermoCast forecasts temperature 2× better than a machine learning approach solely driven by data, and can successfully predict thermal alarms 4.2 minutes ahead of time.},

The increasing number of processors on a single chip opens new opportunity for parallel computing. Our goal is to make use of the multi-core as well as multi-processor architectures to speed up large-scale data mining algorithms. In this paper, we present a general par- allel learning framework, Cut-And-Stitch, for training hidden Markov chain models. Particularly, we propose two model-specific variants, CAS-LDS for learning linear dynamical systems (LDS) and CAS-HMM for learning hidden Markov models (HMM). Our main contribution is a novel method to handle the data dependencies due to the chain structure of hidden variables, so as to parallelize the EM-based parameter learning algorithm. We imple- ment CAS-LDS and CAS-HMM using OpenMP on two supercomputers and a quad-core commercial desktop. The experimental results show that parallel algorithms using Cut-And-Stitch achieve comparable accuracy and almost linear speedups over the traditional serial version.},

Most existing methods are either restricted to a particular class of models (e.g., the Storvik filter) or computationally expensive (e.g., particle MCMC). We propose a novel nearly-black-box algorithm, the Assumed Parameter Filter (APF), a hybrid of particle filtering for state variables and assumed density filtering for parameter variables. It has the following advantages: (a) it is online and computationally efficient; (b) it is applicable to both discrete and continuous parameter spaces with arbitrary transition dynamics. On a variety of toy and real models, APF generates more accurate results within a fixed computation budget compared to several standard algorithms from the literature.},

How quickly does a piece of news spread over these media? How does its popularity diminish over time? Does the rising and falling pattern follow a simple universal law? In this paper, we propose SPIKEM, a concise yet flexible analytical model of the rise and fall patterns of information diffusion. Our model has the following advantages: (a) unification power: it explains earlier empirical observations and generalizes theoretical models including the SI and SIR models. We provide the threshold of the take-off vs. die-out conditions for SPIKEM, and discuss the generality of our model, by applying it to an arbitrary graph topology; (b) practicality: it matches the observed behavior of diverse sets of real data; (c) parsimony: it requires only a handful of parameters; and (d) usefulness: it makes it possible to perform analytic tasks such as forecasting, spotting anomalies, and interpretation by reverse engineering the system parameters of interest (e.g. quality of news, number of interested bloggers, etc.). We also introduce an efficient and effective algorithm for the real-time monitoring of information diffusion, namely, SPIKESTREAM, which identifies multiple diffusion patterns in a large collection of online event streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that SPIKEM accurately and succinctly describes all the patterns of the rise-and-fall spikes in social networks.},

samples in existing co-training methods is based on a predetermined policy,
which ignores the sampling bias between the unlabeled and the labeled subsets,
and fails to explore the data space. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
Reinforced Co-Training, to select high-quality unlabeled samples to better
co-train on. More specifically, our approach uses Q-learning to learn a data
selection policy with a small labeled dataset, and then exploits this policy to
train the co-training classifiers automatically. Experimental results on

  abstract  = {Neural networks with tree-based sentence encoders have shown better results on many downstream tasks. Most of existing tree-based encoders adopt syntactic parsing trees as the explicit structure prior. To study the effectiveness of different tree structures, we replace the parsing trees with trivial trees (i.e., binary balanced tree, left-branching tree and right-branching tree) in the encoders. Though trivial trees contain no syntactic information, those encoders get competitive or even better results on all of the ten downstream tasks we investigated. This surprising result indicates that explicit syntax guidance may not be the main contributor to the superior performances of tree-based neural sentence modeling. Further analysis show that tree modeling gives better results when crucial words are closer to the final representation. Additional experiments give more clues on how to design an effective tree-based encoder.},

  abstract  = {Time series are widely used as signals in many classification/regression tasks. It is ubiquitous that time series contains many missing values. Given multiple correlated time series data, how to fill in missing values and to predict their class labels? Existing imputation methods often impose strong assumptions of the underlying data generating process, such as linear dynamics in the state space. In this paper, we propose BRITS, a novel method based on recurrent neural networks for missing value imputation in time series data. Our proposed method directly learns the missing values in a bidirectional recurrent dynamical system, without any specific assumption. The imputed values are treated as variables of RNN graph and can be effectively updated during the backpropagation.BRITS has three advantages: (a) it can handle multiple correlated missing values in time series; (b) it generalizes to time series with nonlinear dynamics underlying; (c) it provides a data-driven imputation procedure and applies to general settings with missing data.We evaluate our model on three real-world datasets, including an air quality dataset, a health-care data, and a localization data for human activity. Experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both imputation and classification/regression accuracies.},

CNN model is first introduced to classify these numbers on
the deteced players’ images. To localize the jersey number
more precisely without involving another digit detector and
extra consumption, we then improve the former network to
an end-to-end framework by fusing with the spatial transformer
network (STN). To further improve the accuracy, we
bring extra supervision to STN and upgrade the model to
a semi-supervised multi-task learning system, by labeling a
small portion of the number areas in the dataset by quadrangle.
Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework.},

  abstract  = {In real-world applications of natural language generation,
there are often constraints on the target sentences in addition
to fluency and naturalness requirements. Existing language
generation techniques are usually based on recurrent
neural networks (RNNs). However, it is non-trivial to impose
constraints on RNNs while maintaining generation quality,
since RNNs generate sentences sequentially (or with beam
search) from the first word to the last. In this paper, we propose
CGMH, a novel approach using Metropolis-Hastings
sampling for constrained sentence generation. CGMH allows
complicated constraints such as the occurrence of multiple
keywords in the target sentences, which cannot be handled in
traditional RNN-based approaches. Moreover, CGMH works
in the inference stage, and does not require parallel corpora
for training.We evaluate our method on a variety of tasks, including
keywords-to-sentence generation, unsupervised sentence
paraphrasing, and unsupervised sentence error correction.
CGMH achieves high performance compared with previous
supervised methods for sentence generation. Our code

for learning a joint space for scene representation and textual
semantics. It unifies the embeddings of concepts at different
levels: objects, attributes, relations and full scenes. We
view the sentential semantics as a combination of different
semantic components such as object or relational descriptors,
and align their embeddings with different regions of a
scene. A contrastive learning approach is proposed for the
effective learning of such fine-grained alignment from only
image-caption pairs. We also present a simple yet effective
approach that enforces the coverage of caption embeddings
on the semantic components that appear in the sentence. We
demonstrate that the Unified VSE outperforms other baselines
on cross-modal retrieval tasks and the enforcement
of the semantic coverage improves models’ robustness in
defending text-domain adversarial attacks. Moreover, such
robustness empowers the use of visual cues to accurately
resolve word dependencies in novel sentences.},

In this paper, we propose WisCom, a system that can analyze tens of millions user ratings and comments in mobile app markets at three different levels of detail. Our system is able to (a) discover inconsistencies in reviews; (b) identify reasons why users like or dislike a given app, and provide an interactive, zoomable view of how users’ reviews evolve over time; and (c) provide valuable insights into the entire app market, identifying users’ major concerns and preferences of different types of apps. Results using our techniques are reported on a 32GB dataset consisting of over 13 million user reviews of 171,493 Android apps in the Google Play Store. We discuss how the techniques presented herein can be deployed to help a mobile app market operator such as Google as well as individual app developers and end-users.},

In this paper, we propose the Dynamically Fused Graph Network (DFGN), a novel method to answer those questions requiring multiple scattered evidence and reasoning over them. Inspired by human’s step-by-step reasoning behavior, DFGN includes a dynamic fusion layer that starts from the entities mentioned in the given query, explores along the entity graph dynamically built from the text, and gradually finds relevant supporting entities from the given documents. We evaluate DFGN on HotpotQA, a public TBQA dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning. DFGN achieves competitive results on the public board. Furthermore, our analy- sis shows DFGN could produce interpretable reasoning chains.},

  abstract  = {Variational auto-encoders (VAEs) are widely used in natural language generation due to the regularization of the latent space. However, generating sentences from the continuous latent space does not explicitly model the syntactic information. In this paper, we propose to generate sentences from disentangled syntactic and semantic spaces. Our proposed method explicitly models syntactic information in the VAE’s latent space by using the linearized tree sequence, leading to better performance of language generation. Additionally, the advantage of sampling in the disentangled syntactic and semantic latent spaces enables us to perform novel applications, such as the unsupervised paraphrase generation and syntax-transfer generation. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves similar or better performance in various tasks, compared with state-of-the-art related work.},

To solve bothissues, we propose CAMIT, a novel method for translating in an interactive environment. Our proposed method works with critical revision instructions,therefore allows human to correct arbitrary words in model-translated sentences. In addition,CAMIT learns from and softly memorizes revision actions based on the context, alleviating the issue of repeating mistakes. Experiments in both ideal and real interactive translation settings demonstrate that our proposed CAMIT enhances machine translation results significantly while requires fewer revision instructions from human compared to previous methods.},
