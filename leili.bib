  abstract  = {We present a new, embarrassingly simple approach to instance segmentation in images. Compared to many other dense prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, it is the arbitrary number of instances that have made instance segmentation much more challenging. In order to predict a mask for each instance, mainstream approaches either follow the 'detect-thensegment' strategy as used by Mask R-CNN, or predict category masks first then use clustering techniques to group pixels into individual instances. We view the task of instance segmentation from a completely new perspective by introducing the notion of "instance categories", which assigns categories to each pixel within an instance according to the instance's location and size, thus nicely converting instance mask segmentation into a classification-solvable problem. Now instance segmentation is decomposed into two classification tasks. We demonstrate a much simpler and flexible instance segmentation framework with strong performance, achieving on par accuracy with Mask R-CNN and outperforming recent singleshot instance segmenters in accuracy. We hope that this very simple and strong framework can serve as a baseline for many instance-level recognition tasks besides instance segmentation.},

This paper explores the problem of automatically learning reusable "templates" from paired and non-paired data. We propose the variational template machine (VTM), a novel method to generate text descriptions from data tables. Our contributions include:  a) we carefully devise a specific model architecture and losses to explicitly disentangle text template and semantic content information, in the latent spaces, and b) we utilize both small parallel data and large raw text without aligned tables to enrich the template learning. Experiments on datasets from a variety of different domains show that VTM is able generate more diversely while keeping a good fluency and quality.},

Both translation models and language models share the same latent semantic space, therefore both translation directions can learn from non-parallel data more effectively. Besides, the translation models and language models can collaborate together during decoding. Our experiments show that the proposed MGNMT consistently outperforms existing approaches in all a variety of scenarios and language pairs, including resource-rich and low-resource languages.},

Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPAN outperforms existing first-order and second-order optimization methods in terms of the convergence wall-clock time.

Almost all methods treat foreground and background regions (``things and stuff'') in an image equally. However, not all pixels are equal. Depth of foreground objects plays a crucial role in 3D object recognition and localization. To date how to boost the depth prediction accuracy of foreground objects is rarely discussed. In this paper, we first analyse the data distributions and interaction of foreground and background, then propose the foreground-background separated monocular depth estimation (ForeSeE) method, to estimate the foreground depth and background depth using separate optimization objectives and depth decoders. Our method significantly improves the depth estimation performance on foreground objects. Applying ForeSeE to 3D object detection, we achieve 7.5 AP gains and set new state-of-the-art results among other monocular methods.},

To train such a neural headline editing model, we collected a dataset which contains articles with original headlines and professionally edited headlines. However, it is expensive to collect a large number of professionally edited headlines. To solve this low-resource problem, we design an encoder-decoder model which leverages large scale pre-trained language models. We further improve the pre-trained model's quality by introducing a headline generation task as an intermediate task before the headline editing task. Also, we propose Self Importance-Aware (SIA) loss to address the different levels of editing in the dataset by down-weighting the importance of easily classified tokens and sentences. With the help of Pre-training, Adaptation, and SIA, the model learns to generate headlines in the professional editor's style. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the quality of headline editing comparing against previous methods.},

Our proposed \method consists of three techniques:
\begin{inparaenum}[\it a)]
\item asymptotic distillation to ensure that the NMT model can retain the previous pre-trained knowledge;

While for the large WMT14 English-French task with 40 millions of sentence-pairs, our base model still significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art Transformer big model by more than 1 BLEU score.},

In order to train a model to rank the most profitable ads, new ad creatives have to be placed online for hours to receive sufficient user-click data. This corresponds to the cold-start stage. Random strategy lead to inefficiency and inferior selections of potential ads. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of content-based selection during the cold-start stage. Specifically, we propose Pre Evaluation of Ad Creative Model (PEAC), a novel method to evaluate and select ad creatives offline before being placed online. Our proposed PEAC utilizes the automatically extracted deep feature from ad content to predict and rank their potential online placement performance. It does not rely on any user-click data, which is scarce during the cold-starting phase. A large-scale system based on our method has been deployed in a real online advertising platform. The online A/B testing shows the ads system with PEAC pre-ranking obtains significant improvement in revenue gain compared to the prior system. Furthermore, we provide detailed analyses on what the model learned, which gives further suggestions to improve ad creative design.},

CAPSNMT uses an aggregation mechanism to map the source sentence into a matrix with pre-determined size, and then applys a deep LSTM network to decode the target sequence from the source representation. Unlike the previous work (Sutskever et al., 2014) to store the source sentence with a passive and bottom-up way, the dynamic routing policy encodes the source sentence with an iterative process to decide the credit attribution between nodes from lower and higher layers. CAPSNMT has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and provides a more flexible way to aggregate the part-whole information of the source sentence. On WMT14 English-German task and a larger WMT14 English-French task, CAPSNMT achieves comparable results with the Transformer system. We also devise new hybrid architectures intended to combine the strength of CAPSNMT and the RNMT model. Our hybrid models obtain state-of-the-arts results on both benchmark datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that capsule networks have been empirically inves- tigated for sequence to sequence problems},

In this paper, we introduce a large-scale short video dataset, called SVD, for the NDVR task. SVD contains over 500,000 short videos and over 30,000 labeled videos of near-duplicates. We use multiple video mining techniques to construct positive/negative pairs. Furthermore, we design temporal and spatial transformations to mimic user-attack behavior in real applications for constructing more difficult variants of SVD. Experiments show that existing state-of-the-art NDVR methods, including real-value based and hashing based methods, fail to achieve satisfactory performance on this challenging dataset.

Extensive experiments on the VATEX dataset show that, first, the unified multilingual model can not only produce both English and Chinese descriptions for a video more efficiently, but also offer improved performance over the monolingual models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatiotemporal video context can be effectively utilized to align source and target languages and thus assist machine translation.

We start from the observation that in many existing models and datasets, certain words within a sentence play important roles in determining the sentence attribute class. These words are referred to as the Pivot Words. Based on these pivot words, we propose a lexical analysis framework, the Pivot Analysis, to quantitatively analyze the effects of these words in text attribute classification and transfer. We apply this framework to existing datasets and models, and show that: (1) the pivot words are strong features for the classification of sentence attributes; (2) to change the attribute of a sentence, many datasets only requires to change certain pivot words; (3) consequently, many transfer models only perform the lexical-level modification, while leaving higher-level sentence structures unchanged. Our work provides an in-depth understanding of linguistic attribute transfer and further identifies the future requirements and challenges of this task.},

However, due to the lack of fine-grained datarecording such merging phenomena, the co-driven mechanism ofsocial and content links in churn phenomena remains unexplored.How do social and content factors jointly influence customersâ€™churn?

We find that both social and contentlinks have a significant impact on usersâ€™ churn and theywork jointlyas a complicated mixture effect. As a result, we propose a novelsurvival model, which incorporates both social and content factors,to predict churn probability over time.

Our proposed method works with critical revision instructions,therefore allows human to correct arbitrary words in model-translated sentences. In addition,CAMIT learns from and softly memorizes revision actions based on the context, alleviating the issue of repeating mistakes. Experiments in both ideal and real interactive translation settings demonstrate that our proposed CAMIT enhances machine translation results significantly while requires fewer revision instructions from human compared to previous methods.},

However, generating sentences from the continuous latent space does not explicitly model the syntactic information. In this paper, we propose to generate sentences from disentangled syntactic and semantic spaces. Our proposed method explicitly models syntactic information in the VAEâ€™s latent space by using the linearized tree sequence, leading to better performance of language generation. Additionally, the advantage of sampling in the disentangled syntactic and semantic latent spaces enables us to perform novel applications, such as the unsupervised paraphrase generation and syntax-transfer generation. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves similar or better performance in various tasks, compared with state-of-the-art related work.},

In this paper, we propose the Dynamically Fused Graph Network (DFGN), a novel method to answer those questions requiring multiple scattered evidence and reasoning over them. Inspired by humanâ€™s step-by-step reasoning behavior, DFGN includes a dynamic fusion layer that starts from the entities mentioned in the given query, explores along the entity graph dynamically built from the text, and gradually finds relevant supporting entities from the given documents. We evaluate DFGN on HotpotQA, a public TBQA dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning. DFGN achieves competitive results on the public board.

there are often constraints on the target sentences in addition
to fluency and naturalness requirements. Existing language
generation techniques are usually based on recurrent

constraints on RNNs while maintaining generation quality,
since RNNs generate sentences sequentially (or with beam
search) from the first word to the last. In this paper, we propose
CGMH, a novel approach using Metropolis-Hastings
sampling for constrained sentence generation. CGMH allows
complicated constraints such as the occurrence of multiple
keywords in the target sentences, which cannot be handled in
traditional RNN-based approaches. Moreover, CGMH works
in the inference stage, and does not require parallel corpora
for training.We evaluate our method on a variety of tasks, including
keywords-to-sentence generation, unsupervised sentence
paraphrasing, and unsupervised sentence error correction.

Given multiple correlated time series data, how to fill in missing values and to predict their class labels? Existing imputation methods often impose strong assumptions of the underlying data generating process, such as linear dynamics in the state space. In this paper, we propose BRITS, a novel method based on recurrent neural networks for missing value imputation in time series data. Our proposed method directly learns the missing values in a bidirectional recurrent dynamical system, without any specific assumption. The imputed values are treated as variables of RNN graph and can be effectively updated during the backpropagation.BRITS has three advantages: (a) it can handle multiple correlated missing values in time series; (b) it generalizes to time series with nonlinear dynamics underlying; (c) it provides a data-driven imputation procedure and applies to general settings with missing data.We evaluate our model on three real-world datasets, including an air quality dataset, a health-care data, and a localization data for human activity.

Though trivial trees contain no syntactic information, those encoders get competitive or even better results on all of the ten downstream tasks we investigated. This surprising result indicates that explicit syntax guidance may not be the main contributor to the superior performances of tree-based neural sentence modeling. Further analysis show that tree modeling gives better results when crucial words are closer to the final representation.

In this paper, we propose SPIKEM, a concise yet flexible analytical model of the rise and fall patterns of information diffusion. Our model has the following advantages: (a) unification power: it explains earlier empirical observations and generalizes theoretical models including the SI and SIR models. We provide the threshold of the take-off vs. die-out conditions for SPIKEM, and discuss the generality of our model, by applying it to an arbitrary graph topology; (b) practicality: it matches the observed behavior of diverse sets of real data; (c) parsimony: it requires only a handful of parameters; and (d) usefulness: it makes it possible to perform analytic tasks such as forecasting, spotting anomalies, and interpretation by reverse engineering the system parameters of interest (e.g. quality of news, number of interested bloggers, etc.). We also introduce an efficient and effective algorithm for the real-time monitoring of information diffusion, namely, SPIKESTREAM, which identifies multiple diffusion patterns in a large collection of online event streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that SPIKEM accurately and succinctly describes all the patterns of the rise-and-fall spikes in social networks.},

The syntax as described in this document corresponds to BLOG version 0.6. The current version represents a significant redesign and extension to previous versions of BLOG, based on the principles of usability and implementation efficiency.},

  abstract  = {Efficient thermal management is important in modern data centers as cooling consumes up to 50% of the total energy. Unlike previous work, we consider proactive thermal management, whereby servers can predict potential overheating events due to dynamics in data center configuration and workload, giving operators enough time to react. However, such forecasting is very challenging due to data center scales and complexity. Moreover, such a physical system is influenced by cyber effects, including workload scheduling in servers. We propose ThermoCast, a novel thermal forecasting model to predict the temperatures surrounding the servers in a data center, based on continuous streams of temperature and airflow measurements. Our approach is (a) capable of capturing cyber- physical interactions and automatically learning them from data; (b) computationally and physically scalable to data center scales; (c) able to provide online prediction with real-time sensor mea- surements. The paperâ€™s main contributions are: (i) We provide a systematic approach to integrate physical laws and sensor observa- tions in a data center; (ii) We provide an algorithm that uses sensor data to learn the parameters of a data centerâ€™s cyber-physical sys- tem. In turn, this ability enables us to reduce model complexity compared to full-fledged fluid dynamics models, while maintain- ing forecast accuracy; (iii) Unlike previous simulation-based stud- ies, we perform experiments in a production data center. Using real data traces, we show that ThermoCast forecasts temperature 2Ã— better than a machine learning approach solely driven by data, and can successfully predict thermal alarms 4.2 minutes ahead of time.},

Our goal is to make use of the multi-core as well as multi-processor architectures to speed up large-scale data mining algorithms. In this paper, we present a general par- allel learning framework, Cut-And-Stitch, for training hidden Markov chain models. Particularly, we propose two model-specific variants, CAS-LDS for learning linear dynamical systems (LDS) and CAS-HMM for learning hidden Markov models (HMM). Our main contribution is a novel method to handle the data dependencies due to the chain structure of hidden variables, so as to parallelize the EM-based parameter learning algorithm. We imple- ment CAS-LDS and CAS-HMM using OpenMP on two supercomputers and a quad-core commercial desktop. The experimental results show that parallel algorithms using Cut-And-Stitch achieve comparable accuracy and almost linear speedups over the traditional serial version.},
