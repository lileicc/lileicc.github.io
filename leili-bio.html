    <h1>Short Bio:</h1>
    Lei Li is an assistant professor in Computer Science Department at
    University of California Santa Barbara. His research interest lies in
    natural language pro-cessing, machine translation, and machine learning. He
    received his B.S. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Ph.D. from Carnegie
    Mellon University. His dissertation work on fast algorithms for mining
    co-evolving time series was awarded ACM KDD best dissertation (runner up).
    His recent work on AI writer Xiaomingbot received 2nd-class award of Wu
    Wen-ts√ºn AI prize in 2017. He is a recipient of ACL 2021 best paper award,
    CCF Young Elite award in 2019, and CCF distinguished speaker in 2017. His
    team won first places for five language translation directions and the best
    in corpus filtering challenge in WMT 2020. Previously, he worked as a
    post-doctoral researcher at EECS department of UC Berkeley, a principal
    researcher at Baidu's Institute of Deep Learning in Silicon Valley, and at
    ByteDance as the founding director of AI Lab. He has served as Associate
    Editor of TPAMI and organizers and area chair/senior PC for multiple
    conferences including ACL, EMNLP, NeurIPS, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, WSDM, and CIKM.
    He has launched ByteDance's machine translation system (VolcTrans) and
    Xiaomingbot automatic writing system, and many of his algorithms have been
    deployed in production (Toutiao, Douyin, Tiktok, Xigua, Feishu/Lark),
    serving over a billion users. He has delivered five tutorials at ACL 2021,
    EMNLP 2019, NLPCC 2019, NLPCC 2016, and KDD 2010. He was a lecturer for 2014
    Probabilistic Programming for Advancing Machine Learning summer school at
    Portland, USA. <br>
